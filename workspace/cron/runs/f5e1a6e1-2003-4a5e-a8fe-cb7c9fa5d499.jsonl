Since #1055 has human assignment, I should wait.\n\nFor subcults epic #308, many child issues appear completed or closed. The PRs #504 and #533 are still in progress. Since #504 is assigned to human+Copilot, I should wait.\n\nAccording to the workflow rules:\n1. Complete ALL child issues in current epic first\n2. After all children are done, assign the EPIC ITSELF to Copilot for review\n\nSince both repos have child issues either in progress or assigned to humans, I should wait and not assign new issues.\n\nLet me create a summary report:\n\n## GitHub Copilot Manager Report\n\n### Clipper (subculture-collective/clipper)\n- **Current Epic:** #1019 (Voluntary Ban Sync & Community Moderation System)\n- **Active PR:** #1289 (Migration Scripts) - State A (Copilot implementing, no review requested)\n- **Next Issue:** #1056 (Set Up Monitoring & Alerts) - OPEN, unassigned\n- **Blocked by:** #1055 assigned to human+Copilot (must complete first due to dependency)\n- **Action:** Wait for #1055 completion before assigning #1056\n\n### Subcults (subculture-collective/subcults)\n- **Current Epic:** #308 (Security Hardening & Compliance)\n- **Active PRs:** #504 (Security Threat Model) and #533 (Profiling) - Both State A (Copilot implementing)\n- **Blocked by:** #504 assigned to human+Copilot\n- **Many child issues** (#505-509) appear completed/closed\n- **Action:** Wait for #504 completion\n\n### Summary\nBoth repos have active work in progress with Copilot. No new issues should be assigned because:\n1. Clipper: Next issue (#1056) depends on #1055 which has human assignment\n2. Subcults: Current issue (#504) has human assignment\n\nThe workflow will continue monitoring the PRs. When they move from State A (draft) to State B (review requested), we'll mark them ready and request Copilot code review.\n\nHEARTBE…","runAtMs":1770167345502,"durationMs":193134,"nextRunAtMs":1770169338636}
