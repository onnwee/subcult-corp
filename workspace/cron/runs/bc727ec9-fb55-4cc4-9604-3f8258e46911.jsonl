That's unusually high for iCloud (goal is $2.99/mo). Worth checking what Apple billed for.\n\n2. **$36.54 in Twitch** — Two charges ($5.99 + $30.55). The $30.55 is a 6-month gift sub renewal. Expected, but FYI.\n\n3. **Uber Eats $47.51** — Single restaurant order. A bit steep but within discretionary range.\n\n**Budget Status:**\n- Most categories at $0 budgeted / $0 balance (February just started)\n- $63,513 sitting in \"Ready to Assign\" — that's your unassigned pool\n- Credit cards show balances to pay: QuicksilverOne ($3,542), QuicksilverTwo ($1,600), QuicksilverThree ($480), Apple Card ($250)\n\nNothing critically overspent. The double Apple charge is the main thing to verify.","runAtMs":1770040828166,"durationMs":22098,"nextRunAtMs":1770645600000}
